# CASCADE Process Status Report

## Date: 2025-06-01 23:00:00

## Current Situation

We've implemented comprehensive guardrails for private content protection but discovered that main branch has diverged significantly from dev. The CASCADE process is complex due to:

1. Main branch doesn't have the directory profiles feature yet
2. Many merge conflicts between dev and main
3. We need to carefully propagate changes without breaking functionality

## Branch Status

### private (✅ Complete)
- Has all features: directory profiles + guardrails
- All tests passing
- Private files properly tracked
- Updated CLAUDE.md with CASCADE documentation

### dev (✅ Updated)  
- Has directory profiles + guardrails
- Private files removed from tracking
- .gitignore updated with private patterns
- All tests passing

### main (❌ Behind)
- Missing directory profiles feature
- Missing guardrails
- Has diverged from dev with different changes
- Needs careful merge strategy

### test, staging, live (❌ Not updated)
- All behind main
- Will need updates after main is fixed

## Modified CASCADE Strategy

Given the complexity, we should:

1. **Option A: Reset main to dev** (Clean but disruptive)
   - `git checkout main && git reset --hard dev`
   - Loses any unique main changes
   - Clean history going forward

2. **Option B: Cherry-pick features** (Selective)
   - Cherry-pick directory profiles commits
   - Cherry-pick guardrails commits
   - Preserve main's unique changes

3. **Option C: Feature branch merge** (Recommended)
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Merge dev into feature branch
   - Resolve all conflicts carefully
   - Test thoroughly
   - Merge back to main

## Recommendation

Use Option C with this approach:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/sync-from-dev

# Merge dev
git merge dev --no-ff

# Resolve conflicts carefully
# Test thoroughly
# Merge back to main when ready
```

## Key Considerations

1. **Private File Protection**: Ensure .gitignore has private patterns
2. **Test Coverage**: Run full test suite after each merge
3. **Guardrails Installation**: Set up hooks in each branch
4. **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md updated but excluded

## Next Steps

1. Decide on merge strategy for main
2. Execute chosen strategy carefully
3. Test thoroughly in main
4. Continue CASCADE to test → staging → live
5. Push public branches (not private)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Regular Syncs**: Don't let branches diverge too far
2. **Feature Branches**: Use for complex merges
3. **Test Early**: Catch issues before CASCADE
4. **Document Process**: Track what worked/didn't work
