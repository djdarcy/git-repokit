# Universal Bootstrap for Any Project - Using The Process
**Date**: 2025-05-30 22:53:42
**Task**: Design universal bootstrap functionality to migrate any project to RepoKit structure

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Bootstrap Implementation
From analyzing the current scripts, the bootstrap process:
1. Creates a new RepoKit repository structure
2. Uses `repo_manager.bootstrap_repository(source_dir)` to copy files 
3. Publishes to GitHub/GitLab automatically
4. Only works for RepoKit itself currently

### Current Limitations
- Hard-coded for RepoKit-specific patterns
- Assumes starting from clean slate
- No support for existing Git repositories
- No branch strategy variations
- Limited to Python projects

## üîÅ Stage 1: Problem Analysis

### Core Problem Definition
Create a universal bootstrap system that can:
1. Take ANY existing project (with or without Git)
2. Convert it to RepoKit structure with chosen branch strategy  
3. Automatically publish to remote service with proper configuration

### Sub-problems and Dimensions

1. **Project State Detection**
   - No Git repo vs existing Git repo
   - Empty project vs project with files
   - Language detection and appropriate templates
   - Existing remote vs no remote

2. **Git Integration Complexity**
   - Preserving existing Git history
   - Handling existing branches vs creating new ones
   - Dealing with conflicting branch names
   - Managing remotes (origin might already exist)

3. **File Management**
   - What files to preserve vs template
   - Handling conflicts between existing files and templates
   - Language-specific file detection
   - Credential and sensitive file exclusion

4. **Branch Strategy Application**
   - User might want standard, simple, gitflow, etc.
   - Each strategy has different branch requirements
   - Worktree setup varies by strategy

5. **Remote Service Integration**
   - GitHub vs GitLab vs others
   - Repository already exists vs needs creation
   - Public vs private
   - Organization vs personal

### Constraints and Considerations

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must preserve existing work/history when possible
- Must work with various Git states
- Must handle authentication securely

**User Experience Constraints:**
- Should be a single command when possible
- Must ask for confirmation on destructive operations
- Clear error messages for edge cases

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
- Repository with uncommitted changes
- Conflicting branch names (user has 'staging' but different meaning)
- Existing remote with same name as target
- Large repositories with complex history
- Projects with submodules
- Binary files and large assets

## üîÅ Stage 2: Conceptual Exploration

### Why This Problem Exists
- Current bootstrap is RepoKit-specific proof of concept
- General project migration is complex with many variations
- No standard for repository structure migration

### Mental Models

1. **Migration Pipeline Model**
   ```
   Detect ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Publish
   ```

2. **State Machine Model**
   - Initial State: Any project directory
   - Transitions: Based on what we detect
   - Final State: RepoKit-structured repo on remote

3. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Different adapters for different project states
   - Common interface for all migration paths

### Approach Types

1. **Destructive Approach**
   - Start fresh, copy what we need
   - Simple but loses Git history
   - Fast and predictable

2. **Preservation Approach**  
   - Detect and preserve existing structure
   - Complex but keeps history
   - May require conflict resolution

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Preserve when safe, recreate when necessary
   - Best user experience
   - Most complex implementation

## üîÅ Stage 3: Brainstorming Solutions

### Solution 1: Enhanced Bootstrap Command
Extend existing bootstrap with project detection.

**Implementation:**
```bash
repokit bootstrap /path/to/project --strategy standard --publish-to github
```

**Pros:**
- Builds on existing functionality
- Familiar command structure
- Can reuse existing code

**Cons:**
- "Bootstrap" doesn't feel right for existing projects
- Command name confusion

### Solution 2: New "Migrate" Command  
Create dedicated migration command.

**Implementation:**
```bash
repokit migrate /path/to/project --strategy standard --publish-to github
```

**Pros:**
- Clear intent and naming
- Can have migrate-specific options
- Separates concerns from bootstrap

**Cons:**
- More commands to maintain
- Duplicate functionality with bootstrap

### Solution 3: Smart "Import" Command
Intelligent import that detects and adapts.

**Implementation:**
```bash
repokit import /path/to/project --strategy standard --target my-new-repo --publish-to github
```

**Pros:**
- Very clear what it does
- Can be smart about detection
- Natural workflow

**Cons:**
- Another command
- "Import" might imply read-only

### Solution 4: Enhanced "Create" with Source
Extend create command to accept source directory.

**Implementation:**
```bash
repokit create my-repo --from /path/to/project --strategy standard --publish-to github
```

**Pros:**
- Single command paradigm
- Natural extension of create
- Unified workflow

**Cons:**
- Overloading create command
- Might be confusing

### Solution 5: "Adopt" Command
Command that "adopts" an existing project.

**Implementation:**
```bash
repokit adopt /path/to/project --name my-repo --strategy standard --publish-to github
```

**Pros:**
- Perfect naming for the concept
- Clear that it's working with existing project
- Intuitive workflow

**Cons:**
- New command to implement
- Less obvious than migrate

## üîÅ Stage 4: Synthesis and Recommendation

### Recommended Approach: Enhanced "Migrate" + Smart Detection

Combine the best elements:

1. **From Solution 2**: Use "migrate" command for clarity
2. **From Solution 3**: Smart detection and adaptation
3. **From Solution 1**: Leverage existing bootstrap infrastructure
4. **From Solution 5**: Adopt the "adopt" concept for in-place migration

### Specific Design:

```bash
# Migrate existing project to new RepoKit repo
repokit migrate /path/to/project my-new-repo --strategy standard --publish-to github

# Adopt current directory as RepoKit repo  
repokit adopt . --strategy standard --publish-to github

# Preview mode
repokit migrate /path/to/project my-new-repo --dry-run
```

### Key Features:
1. **Dual Commands**: `migrate` (source‚Üínew) and `adopt` (in-place)
2. **Smart Detection**: Automatically detect project state
3. **Strategy Support**: All branch strategies supported  
4. **Dry Run**: Preview changes before execution
5. **Preservation**: Keep Git history when possible
6. **Integration**: Full remote service integration

### Implementation Architecture:
```
ProjectAnalyzer ‚Üí MigrationPlan ‚Üí MigrationExecutor ‚Üí RemotePublisher
     ‚Üì               ‚Üì               ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  - Git detection   - File mapping  - Repo creation  - GitHub/GitLab
  - Language detect - Branch plan   - File copy      - Branch push
  - File analysis   - Conflict res  - Git setup     - Settings config
```

## üîÅ Stage 5: Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create `ProjectAnalyzer` class for detection
2. Create `MigrationPlan` class for planning
3. Create `MigrationExecutor` class for execution
4. Add CLI commands for migrate/adopt

### Phase 2: Git Integration
