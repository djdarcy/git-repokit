# Private Branch Setup
**Date**: 2025-05-30 20:57:33
**Task**: Create private branch structure and configure for local-only tracking

## Summary

Successfully created a private branch structure with the following components:
- Created `private` branch for local-only version control
- Set up `private/claude/` directory for documentation
- Moved `CLAUDE.md` and `revisions/` folder to private branch
- Configured git to prevent accidental pushing of private branch
- Updated CLAUDE.md with guidelines for private branch usage

## Commands Executed

### 1. Create and switch to private branch
```bash
git checkout -b private
```
Output: `Switched to a new branch 'private'`

### 2. Create directory structure
```bash
mkdir -p private/claude
```

### 3. Document git merge commands
Created file: `private/claude/2025_05_30__20_48_40__git_merge_main_to_dev.md`

### 4. Stage documentation file (with force due to .gitignore)
```bash
git add -f private/claude/2025_05_30__20_48_40__git_merge_main_to_dev.md
```

### 5. First commit
```bash
git commit -m "Add git merge documentation for main to dev merge"
```

### 6. Add revisions folder and CLAUDE.md
```bash
git add -f revisions/
git add -f CLAUDE.md
```

### 7. Update CLAUDE.md with private branch guidelines
Added sections for:
- Documentation Requirements
- Version Control Practices
- Private Content Structure
- Excluded Content rules

### 8. Configure git to prevent pushing
```bash
git config branch.private.remote "no_push"
```

### 9. Final commit
```bash
git commit -m "Add CLAUDE.md and revisions to private branch with documentation guidelines"
```

## Key Configuration Points

1. **Private branch is local-only**: Configured with `no_push` remote to prevent accidental pushing
2. **Documentation structure**: All work documented in `private/claude/YYYY_MM_DD__HH_MM_SS__(TOPIC).md`
3. **Version control practices**: Frequent commits with minimal unnecessary changes
4. **Protected directories**: `private/`, `convos/`, and `logs/` are protected from commits on other branches
5. **Revisions folder**: Only exists in private branch, not in dev/main/test/staging/live

## Next Steps

Going forward, all work should be documented in timestamped files within `private/claude/` directory, with frequent commits to track changes incrementally.
