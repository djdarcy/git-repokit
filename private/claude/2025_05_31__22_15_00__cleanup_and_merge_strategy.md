# Cleanup and Merge Strategy Implementation

## Date: 2025-05-31 22:15:00

## Summary
After recovering from the git filter-branch disaster and restoring directory profiles functionality, we cleaned up the dev branch by removing private files that had been accidentally pushed to GitHub. We then implemented fixes and began working on a comprehensive merge strategy.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Cleaned up dev branch
- Removed CLAUDE.md and private/claude/* files from dev branch
- Committed with discrete message "chore: remove dev-only files"

### 2. Merged directory profiles to dev
- Successfully merged directory profiles functionality from private to dev
- Handled merge conflicts by keeping private files excluded
- Removed test-runs/ directory that shouldn't be committed

### 3. Fixed CLI bug
- Fixed AttributeError with branch_config by adding hasattr check
- Cherry-picked fix back to private branch

### 4. Test status
- All unit tests passing (19 tests)
- All directory profile tests passing (16 tests)
- Integration tests need some work but core functionality is solid

## Current State
- private branch: Has all functionality including directory profiles + CLI fix
- dev branch: Has directory profiles functionality without private files + CLI fix
- Both branches are now properly separated with private content only in private

## Next Steps
1. Commit all conversation logs in private branch to prevent future loss
2. Remove test-runs from git tracking in private
3. Implement comprehensive merge strategy tooling to prevent private leakage
4. Continue merge workflow: dev → main → test → staging → live

## Lessons Learned
- Always commit conversation logs frequently in private branch
- Need better guardrails to prevent private content from leaking to public branches
- Branch-conditional excludes work but need automation for merge process
