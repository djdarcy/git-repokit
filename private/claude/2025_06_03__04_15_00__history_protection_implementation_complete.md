Topic: Summary of enhanced private branch protection implementation

## What We Accomplished

Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive history protection system for RepoKit that prevents sensitive commit history from leaking to public branches.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. History Protection Module (`repokit/history_protection.py`)
- `HistoryProtectionManager` class with full functionality
- Branch rule system with pattern matching
- Commit message sanitization with sensitive pattern detection
- Smart commit message generation from squashed history
- Support for different merge actions (squash, preserve, interactive)

### 2. CLI Integration
- New `safe-merge-dev` command added to RepoKit CLI
- Full argument support (--squash, --no-squash, --message, --preview)
- Integrated with existing configuration system
- Comprehensive help documentation

### 3. Configuration System
- Support for `.repokit.json` configuration
- Branch rules with glob patterns
- Customizable sensitive patterns
- Example configuration in `configs/history-protection.json`

### 4. Testing
- Comprehensive test suite (`tests/one-offs/test_history_protection.py`)
- UNCtools scenario demonstration (`tests/one-offs/test_unctools_history_scenario.py`)
- All tests passing successfully

### 5. Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with usage instructions
- Complete design document using THE PROCESS
- Example configurations and usage patterns

## How It Works

### Branch Categories (Default Behavior)
- `prototype/*`, `experiment/*`, `spike/*` → Auto-squash (development branches)
- `feature/*` → Interactive (ask user)
- `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*` → Preserve history (important for tracking)

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Auto-squash a prototype branch
repokit safe-merge-dev prototype/new-feature

# Interactive merge for feature branch
repokit safe-merge-dev feature/oauth

# Force behavior
repokit safe-merge-dev feature/api --squash
repokit safe-merge-dev experiment/test --no-squash

# Preview without merging
repokit safe-merge-dev branch-name --preview
```

## Problem Solved

This implementation directly addresses the issue discovered during UNCtools deployment where development branches (prototype, feat/clean-up) contained sensitive commit history that would have been exposed if pushed to GitHub. Now:

1. **Automatic Protection**: Development branches are automatically squashed
2. **Sensitive Info Removal**: Patterns like "secret", "private/", "TODO: hack" are redacted
3. **Clean History**: Public branches get professional, sanitized commit messages
4. **Flexibility**: Users can override behavior when needed
5. **Transparency**: Preview mode shows exactly what will happen

## Impact

- Developers can work freely in development branches without worrying about history
- Sensitive information (paths, customer names, debug code) stays private
- Public repositories get clean, professional commit history
- No change to existing workflows - just use `safe-merge-dev` instead of `git merge`

## Future Enhancements

While Phase 1 is complete and functional, potential future improvements include:
- Interactive message editing
- Partial squashing (preserve last N commits)
- Integration with CASCADE protocol
- Pre-push warnings for unsquashed branches
- Smart commit grouping

## Conclusion

The enhanced private branch protection feature is now fully implemented and tested. It provides a robust solution to the problem of sensitive commit history leaking to public repositories while maintaining developer productivity and flexibility.
