# Private Content Guardrails Design - Using THE PROCESS

## Date: 2025-05-31 22:25:00

## üîÅ THE PROCESS - 5 Stages

### Stage 1: Problem Analysis

**Core Problem**: Developers need to maintain private content in specific branches while ensuring it never leaks to public branches during merges, commits, or pushes.

**Sub-problems/Dimensions**:
1. **Branch Awareness**: System needs to know which branch allows what content
2. **Merge Safety**: Merges can accidentally include private files
3. **Human Error**: Developers forget to exclude files or use wrong commands
4. **Git Complexity**: History rewriting is dangerous and can cause data loss
5. **Workflow Friction**: Safety measures shouldn't impede development

**Edge Cases & Risks**:
- Cherry-picking commits that contain private files
- Submodules or subtrees that might expose private content
- CI/CD systems that might cache private files
- Developers working across multiple branches simultaneously
- Emergency hotfixes that bypass normal workflow

**Short-term vs Long-term**:
- Short-term: Need immediate protection against accidental exposure
- Long-term: Need seamless workflow that makes private leakage impossible

### Stage 2: Conceptual Exploration

**WHY this problem exists**:
- Git treats all content equally - no built-in concept of "private"
- Branch switching shares working directory state
- Merge operations are content-agnostic
- Human memory is fallible under pressure

**Mental Models**:
1. **Airport Security Model**: Multiple checkpoints, each catching different threats
2. **Airgap Model**: Physical separation between classified and unclassified systems
3. **Immune System Model**: Multiple layers of defense, automatic response
4. **Traffic Light Model**: Clear visual indicators of safe/unsafe states

**Relationships**:
- Private content ‚Üî Branch context
- Developer intent ‚Üî Git operations
- Safety measures ‚Üî Workflow efficiency
- Automation ‚Üî Developer control

### Stage 3: Brainstorming Solutions

**Solution 1: Multi-Layer Pre-Commit Hooks**
- Pre-commit hook checks current branch
- Validates files against branch-specific rules
- Blocks commits with private content in public branches
- Visual warnings in terminal

Pros:
- Catches errors at commit time
- Works with existing git workflow
- Can be customized per project

Cons:
- Can be bypassed with --no-verify
- Only catches at commit time, not during merge
- Requires hook installation

**Solution 2: RepoKit Branch-Aware Commands**
- Replace git merge with `repokit merge`
- Replace git commit with `repokit commit`
- Commands understand branch context and excludes

Pros:
- Complete control over operations
- Can preview changes before applying
- Consistent safety across all operations

Cons:
- Learning curve for new commands
- Developers might use git directly
- More complex implementation

**Solution 3: Worktree-Based Isolation**
- Each branch has dedicated worktree
- Private branch worktree has different .gitignore
- Physical separation prevents accidents

Pros:
- Strong isolation
- No accidental file sharing
- Clear mental model

Cons:
- More disk space
- Complex setup
- Not all developers familiar with worktrees

**Solution 4: Git Attributes + Clean/Smudge Filters**
- Use .gitattributes to mark private files
- Clean filter removes content when moving to public branch
- Smudge filter restores when moving to private branch

Pros:
- Automatic content filtering
- Works transparently
- No command changes needed

Cons:
- Complex to debug
- Can corrupt files if misconfigured
- Performance overhead

**Solution 5: Branch Protection Service**
- Background service monitors git operations
- Validates operations before they complete
- Can block/rollback dangerous operations

Pros:
- Works with any git tool
- Continuous protection
- Can learn patterns

Cons:
- Resource overhead
- Complex implementation
- May feel intrusive

### Stage 4: Synthesis and Recommendation

**Optimal Approach**: Layered Defense System

Combine the best elements:
1. **Core**: Enhanced pre-commit hooks (Solution 1)
2. **Enhancement**: RepoKit safe commands (Solution 2)
3. **Best Practice**: Worktree setup (Solution 3)
4. **Advanced**: Optional git attributes (Solution 4)

**Key Principles**:
- Defense in depth - multiple checkpoints
- Fail safe - block dangerous operations
- Clear feedback - developers understand why
- Gradual adoption - basic to advanced features

### Stage 5: Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)**
- Create branch detection utility
- Implement basic pre-commit hook
- Add branch-aware status command
- Document private branch workflow

Milestones:
- [ ] Branch detection working
- [ ] Pre-commit blocking private files
- [ ] Status shows branch context

**Phase 2: Enhanced Hooks (3-4 days)**
- Pre-merge hook to check incoming changes
- Post-checkout hook to update excludes
- Pre-push hook for final validation
- Visual indicators in prompts

Milestones:
- [ ] All hooks implemented
- [ ] Testing framework for hooks
- [ ] Clear error messages

**Phase 3: Safe Commands (1 week)**
- Implement `repokit safe-merge`
- Implement `repokit safe-commit`
- Add `--preview` mode for all commands
- Integration with existing CLI

Milestones:
- [ ] Commands working
- [ ] Preview mode functional
- [ ] Rollback capability

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (2 weeks)**
- Worktree automation setup
- Git attributes configuration
- Branch protection service (optional)
- Performance optimization

Milestones:
- [ ] Worktree setup automated
- [ ] Attributes working (if viable)
- [ ] Performance acceptable

**Resources Needed**:
- Git hooks documentation
- Testing repositories
- Various git scenarios for testing
- User feedback for UX

**Contingency Plans**:
- If hooks bypassed: Implement server-side checks
- If performance issues: Make features optional
- If too complex: Simplify to core features only

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero private content leaks in testing
- Minimal workflow disruption (<5% slower)
- Clear understanding by developers
- Works with existing tools

## Immediate Implementation

Let's start with Phase 1 - creating a robust pre-commit hook that understands RepoKit's branch structure and prevents private content from being committed to public branches.
