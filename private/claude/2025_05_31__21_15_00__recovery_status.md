# Recovery Status Report

## Date: 2025-05-31 21:15:00

## What We've Recovered

### 1. configs/ Directory ✓
Recreated based on conversation logs:
- minimal-python.json
- standard-web.json
- complete-enterprise.json
- custom-ml-project.json
- README.md

These files demonstrate the intended configuration system, even though the functionality isn't implemented yet.

### 2. CLAUDE.md ✓
Recreated from template and enhanced with current project knowledge.

### 3. Conversation Logs
Most logs are present but some are empty/corrupted:
- ❌ 2025_05_31__18_27_37__directory_profiles_cli_integration.md (empty)
- ✓ 2025_05_31__19_45_00__directory_profiles_cli_session_recovery.md (has content)
- ✓ Other logs appear intact

## What's Still Missing

### 1. Directory Profiles Implementation
The commit message mentioned this was done, but the code shows:
- No CLI arguments for --dir-profile, --dir-groups, --private-set
- No integration of DirectoryProfileManager in RepoManager
- No unit tests for directory profiles
- No version bump to 0.3.0

**Conclusion**: This work was either never completed or was lost before committing.

### 2. Lost Conversation Content
Some conversation logs are empty, suggesting they were corrupted during the filter-branch operation.

### 3. Any Other Untracked Work
Unknown what other work-in-progress files may have been lost.

## Current Git State

### Private Branch
- At commit d8ef7c9 but missing the actual directory profiles implementation
- Has CLAUDE.md and private/claude/ files as expected
- Has test artifacts that should be cleaned up

### Dev Branch  
- At commit a4d76fc which still contains private files
- Needs proper cleanup without damaging other branches
- Should NOT have CLAUDE.md or private/claude/ files

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Commit Current Recovery Work**
   - configs/ directory
   - Recovery documentation
   - Updated CLAUDE.md

2. **Clean Up Test Artifacts**
   - Remove test-runs/ from git tracking
   - Add proper .gitignore entries

3. **Fix Dev Branch**
   - Remove private files without using filter-branch
   - Use proper branch-conditional excludes

4. **Implement Safety Measures**
   - Create pre-operation checklist
   - Add warnings for dangerous git operations
   - Implement backup procedures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Commit Work Immediately** - The directory profiles work was lost because it wasn't committed
2. **Never Use --all with filter-branch** - Target specific branches only
3. **Check for Untracked Files** - Before any history rewrite operation
4. **Verify Commit Contents** - Don't trust commit messages alone
5. **Create Backups** - Before any dangerous operation

## Next Steps

1. Commit this recovery work
2. Properly clean dev branch using safer methods
3. Consider implementing the directory profiles feature properly
4. Add safety features to RepoKit to prevent this disaster for users
