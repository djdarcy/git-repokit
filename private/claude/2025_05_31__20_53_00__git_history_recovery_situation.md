# Git History Recovery Situation

## Current Situation Summary

We attempted to clean private files (CLAUDE.md and private/claude/) from the dev branch to prevent them from being exposed when pushing to GitHub. However, the cleanup went too far:

1. Used `git filter-branch --all` which rewrote ALL branches, not just public ones
2. This removed CLAUDE.md and private/claude/ files from the private branch where they should exist
3. The directory profiles functionality that was supposedly in commit d8ef7c9 appears to be incomplete or lost

## Branch States

### Private Branch
- Currently at: d8ef7c9 "feature(cli): add directory profiles and enhanced help system"
- Issue: The commit message mentions functionality that doesn't appear to be in the code
- Missing: configs/ directory, CLI changes for --dir-profile, test updates
- CLAUDE.md was removed by filter-branch but has been recreated

### Dev Branch  
- Currently at: a4d76fc "merge: bring private changes to dev"
- Still contains private files that need to be removed
- Needs proper cleanup without affecting private branch

## What Should Have Been Done

1. The directory profiles functionality should have included:
   - CLI arguments: --dir-profile, --dir-groups, --private-set
   - configs/ directory with example configurations
   - Integration of DirectoryProfileManager into RepoManager
   - Unit tests for directory profiles
   - Version bump to 0.3.0

2. For cleaning dev branch:
   - Should have used branch-specific filtering, not --all
   - Or manually removed files with git rm --cached on dev branch only
   - Set up .git/info/exclude before merging

## Recovery Strategy

1. First, properly implement/recover the directory profiles functionality in private
2. Then handle the dev branch cleanup more carefully
3. Use branch-conditional excludes properly before merging

## Lessons Learned

- Never use `git filter-branch --all` when you only want to affect specific branches
- Always verify what's actually in a commit before relying on commit messages
- Test dangerous git operations on a backup first
