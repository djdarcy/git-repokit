# Context Rebuilder Instructions

When resuming work or switching between sessions, follow these steps to rebuild context:

## 1. Initial Context Evaluation
- Review any provided summaries, notes, or partial conversations
- Identify the main topic/goal and current project status
- Note important artifacts, files, or references mentioned

## 2. Reconstructing Full Context
- **Project Objectives**: Clearly restate what is being aimed for
- **Current Situation**: Summarize current phase, tasks in progress, recent developments
- **Prior Decisions**: State decisions made with their justification
- **Known Constraints**: Time, resources, technical limitations
- **Outstanding Issues**: Open questions, risks, or ambiguities

## 3. Handling Ambiguous Context
If information is unclear, ask specific questions:
- "Could you clarify the main objective?"
- "What is the current status of [specific feature]?"
- "Are there any critical constraints I should know about?"

## 4. Context Verification
Summarize the reconstructed context back to confirm accuracy:
- "Based on the provided information, here's my understanding..."
- "Please confirm or correct any misunderstandings"

## 5. For Code Projects
When context is missing, ask for:
1. Summary of previous conversation
2. List of project files (`tree` or `ls` output)
3. Key source files currently being worked on
4. Any specific technical constraints or requirements
