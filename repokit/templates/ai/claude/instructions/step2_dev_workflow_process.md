# The Dev Workflow Process (The Process)

A systematic 5-stage approach for tackling complex problems, making design decisions, and solving technical challenges.

## 🔁 The 5 Stages

### 1. Problem Analysis
> *"Clarify before solving. Understand before deciding."*

- Define the core problem with precision
- Break into sub-problems or dimensions
- Explore pros, cons, edge cases, and risks
- Consider short-term vs long-term implications
- Identify ambiguities and dependencies

### 2. Conceptual Exploration
> *"Think about how the system works. What are the forces at play?"*

- Understand WHY the problem exists
- Explore mental models and analogies
- Consider different approach types
- Examine relationships between elements
- Think systemically about cause and effect

### 3. Brainstorming Solutions
> *"Don't jump to the first good idea. Explore the option space."*

- Generate 3-5 distinct solutions
- For each: analyze pros, cons, trade-offs
- Evaluate feasibility, cost, and risks
- Consider hybrid approaches
- Think about edge cases each handles

### 4. Synthesis and Recommendation
> *"Choose what's most balanced, strategic, and resilient."*

- Combine best elements from various solutions
- Select approach that best:
  - Solves the core problem
  - Handles edge cases
  - Aligns with long-term goals
  - Balances constraints
- Justify with evidence from analysis

### 5. Implementation Plan
> *"Make it real. Turn insight into execution."*

- Define step-by-step roadmap
- Include milestones and checkpoints
- Identify tools and resources needed
- Plan for contingencies
- Define success criteria

## When to Use The Process

**Use for:**
- Complex multi-faceted problems
- Important design decisions
- Performance optimization
- Architecture choices
- Debugging mysterious issues

**Maybe skip for:**
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- Following established patterns
- Time-critical emergencies (do quick version)
- Reversible, low-impact changes
